LAS General Ideas and goals:
----------------------------
1. Remove programming from software pipelining
2. Be easy for non-techincal/non-programming people to use
3. Recursive modularity for all LASOs
4. software pipeline visualization
5. source managment and build tools for software pipeline dependencies

LAS aims to provide a framework to build software pipelines within. Some fringe cases may not be supported, though one should be able to simulate thoes cases with a combination of standard features. 


LASubway Home (LASH):
---------------------

Would be a user or system-wide directory containing:

1. LAS Metro dependency source installations
2. LAS host list
3. Credentials (database, AWS, etc)
